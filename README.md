# MileStone Project Two
## Task Tracker

In today's world there are ususally a million and one things going on in a given day. It's sometimes difficult to keep track 
of all the tasks and errands that need to be completed resulting in somethings not getting done or forgotten. Having one 
place to check for reference, track and store these daily tasks is an extremely help full resource. 

This project is a simple and responsive design which is super user friendly. It allows the user to break down their daily tasks into sections or categories of their choice, for example, work, study or exercise. Within in these categories their tasks are broken down and automatically tracked once a task is completed and displayed conveniently in a progress bar.

## Features
### Existing Features
* Easy, simple design to allow for seamless navigation.
* Task category section to break tasks down into separate headings.
* Ability to customize category section into headings of your own choice with as many categories as you need.
* Categories can be deleted using the delete category button and added using the “add new category “text box.
* When a particular category is selected, the selected category is highlighted and the corresponding task list is shown on the right hand side of the desktop or below on a smaller device.
* The task list can also be modified as the user likes by adding and checking off completed tasks as they go. 
* There is a clear completed task button below the task list so the user can clear them out of the list as they go. 
* On the right had corner of the task list there is also a task counter. This also changes responsively to the amount of tasks still remaining to be completed within the category. 
* There is also a responsive progress bar that correlates with the amount of tasks remaining within the task list to give the user a visual cue of how many tasks have been completed. 
* The categories, tasks, checked and unchecked tasks are stored in local storage so when the user reloads the page their tasks are still there.

### Features Left to Implement

* Adding a calender feature API to link with google calander so appointments automatically link to tasks. 
* Along with the calender tasks could then be integrated with a times of the day tasks need to be completed so the day could be better planned out.
* For a mobile app, reminder notifications could also be installed to pop up if tasks were due to be completed at a certain time.
* An ability to add links to other apps. For example, if 10,000 steps was a task to be completed, there would be an option to link your FitBit account to allow for seamless and automatic task completion without having to manually check it off.

## Deployment

A repository was created on GitHub and Gitpod was used to write the code. The code was commited and pushed to Github regularly to ensure it was saved. The GitHub repository was then deployed to GitHub pages by:

1. Logging into GitHub
2. Selecting repositories and then Milestone_1
3. Then select settings from the top menu bar.
4. Under GitHub pages
5. Under source, select master branch.
6. The website is now deployed and a link appears for the deployed site.
7. This link can now be cloned and run locally.
